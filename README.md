Coursework from CU Boulder's ECEN 2270 Electronics Design Lab.

## ECEN 2270 Electronics Design Lab

Provides an introduction to analysis, modeling, design, and testing of analog electronic circuits in a practical laboratory setting. The laboratory is centered around a robot platform and includes design, SPICE simulations, prototyping and testing of circuits necessary to drive and remotely control the robot.

Included in this repository are the LTspice files to simulate this circuit, as well as some basic Arduino code to manuever the robot.

### Software Needed

You will need LTspice in order to open and edit the files.
You can download it from Analog.
